                            We also have lots of support from the Canadian Space Agency and other government departments and companies. 
                            So we like to think of this event as the NASA International Space Apps Challenge with a Canadian flavour!

                            Start by taking a good look through the challenges and select a few that interest you. 
                            At the start of the event, all registrants will receive login information to an online collaboration place, 
                            where prospective team members can share information together.

                        <p>
                            We recommend a team is at least 3 people, ideally 4-6. If there is a lot of demand for a particular challenge 
                            you can all work together but form sub-teams.

                            Networking is important here. To put a great team together, you'll have to chat with people. Everybody has something 
                            they can offer. Before the event, we will be inviting you to a Canada-wide Discord channel which has a subchannel for 
                            our Ottawa event. You can find team members or join an existing team using that.

                            We have additional assistance from the Canadian Space Agency who can provide expert help on their challenges and data.
                            We also have a Discord server that allows us to communicate with our fellow Canadian cities.
                            And last but definitely not least, we encourage teams to help each other out over the weekend.

                            solutions and pick a shortlist for consideration by NASA or CSA. Those organizations will then review the finalists 
                            from each city and determine the overall winners. Details will be explained during the event.
